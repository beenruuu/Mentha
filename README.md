# 🌿 Mentha — Control Your Brand in AI Engines
#file:mentha-preview.png

> **The definitive open-source platform for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).**

Mentha is an AEO/GEO platform that audits, measures, and optimizes how conversational AIs talk about your brand. It doesn't do traditional SEO. It doesn't generate "SEO content". It controls your brand narrative across the new AI frontiers: **ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini.**

---

## 🚀 Why Mentha?

Traditional SEO is fading. Search behavior has shifted from "10 blue links" to interactive conversational answers. 

- **👉 If an AI is wrong about your brand, Mentha detects it.**
- **👉 If a competitor appears more than you, Mentha shows it.**
- **👉 If you aren't being cited, Mentha tells you why and how to fix it.**

Decisions no longer start with a Google query; they start with an AI response. **Mentha helps brands control those responses.**
